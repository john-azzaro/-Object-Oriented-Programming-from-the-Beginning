**Object oriented programming is is not a language or tool but a programming paradigm that centers around objects rather than functions.** Object oriented programming is used in languages such as C#, Java, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, etc. as well frameworks like Anugular as well. Object oriented programming problems are modelled as a collection of collaborating objects that send messages to each other.

Before object oriented programming there was something called "procedural programming" where data was stored in a bunch of variables and function that operate on the data, which was very simple and straight forward. But eventually these functions will break and function will have duplicate lines of codes (i.e. spaghetti code). With object-oriented programming (OOP), you combine a group of related variables and functions into a unit.
