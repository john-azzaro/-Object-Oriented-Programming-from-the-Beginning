**Object oriented programming is is not a language or tool but a programming paradigm that centers around objects rather than functions.** Object oriented programming is used in languages such as C#, Java, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, etc. as well frameworks like Anugular as well. 

Object oriented programming problems can be modelled as a collection of collaborating objects that send messages to each other.
